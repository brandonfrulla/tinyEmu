    > updated workLog
Nov 8 2020 - Worked from 16:30 - 20:30
    > Continued eliminating bugs from ifelse.s, sumloop.s
    > Built out majority of switchStatement.s and eliminated bugs
Nov 11 2020 - Worked from 15:20 - 19:00
    > Continued implementation of Assembly code programs
    > updated workLog
Nov 13 2020 - Worked from 12:00 - 14:45
    > Started implementation for Decode function
    > updated workLog
Nov 14 2020 - Worked from 09:00 - 17:30
    > Added to decode function, debugged
    > Implemented majority of sumloop.s 
Nov 15 2020 - Worked from 16:00 - 20:25
    > Worked on assembly functions more
    > updated workLog
Nov 18 2020 - Worked from 11:00 - 15:45
    > Continued working on assembly functions
    > finished decode function implementation
    > began work on step function
    > updated workLog
Nov 21 2020 - Worked from 15:00 - 18:30
    > finished up sumloop.s
    > continued assembly implementation on ifelse.s function
    > finished up step function (still have to fix the output print statements though)
    > updated workLog
Nov 22 2020 - Worked from 09:00 - 13:00, 17:00 - 19:00
    > generated .tisa files from ifelse.s and other completed .s files
    > began implementation for the different show_reg functions 
    > updated workLog
Nov 23 2020 - Worked from 08:00 - 21:00
    > Implementated a few changes to step(), namely the error catching and default case in the switch statement
    > continued implementation for invalidinstruction.s
    > updated workLog
    > translated .s files into .txt files consistent with teasm syntax
    > began inmplementation of various b cases to the step function
Nov 24 2020 - Worked from 9:30 - 20:00
    > continued b case implementation 
    > finished .s files and translated them to teasm format
    > ran testing with gusty driver
    > troubleshooting various translation errors in the teasm files
Nov 25 2020 - Worked from 08:00 - 16:30
    > did final debugging and ensured successful runs
    > updated worklog final time
    > cleaned up git repos
    > finalized step function as well as step_show_mem and step_show_mem_reg
    > fin
